                      UNIADA 2018 futsal tournament is organized both in male and female competitions. The teams will
                  start their competition from a group stage, while the number of groups and teams in the group will

                  is subsequently impossible to determine the two best teams (or one best team) in this case, the draw
                  will determine who will qualify.
